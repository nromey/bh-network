Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>On this Techzoom Rob NC5R and Joel W0CAS talk to Jeff K4DKW about his outreach program in schools and blind centers in Ohio. Joel challenged all blind hams to contact schools for the blind in your state to find out if they have any ham activity such as club station or classes. If not ask if we can come by and do a demonstration of the accessible equipment we have. We can also talk about how important the hobby and service ham radio is to society.
