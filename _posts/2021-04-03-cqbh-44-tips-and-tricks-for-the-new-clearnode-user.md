Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>Today Julian N1CA helps Joel W0CAS fine tune his new ClearNode allstar node. The only thing I had to change is the bandwith setting in the codeplug from 12.5 khz to 25 khz. With the info Gerry ask for when you order a node, you get a great working AllStar node out of the box. You can get your ClearNode here.</p>
