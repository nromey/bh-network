Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>On this show Joe KA9OPL gives us a tutorial with the Marlin P. Jones talking multi meter.</p>
<p>This multimeter provides both visual and spoken readout of measurements.<br>It does not announce its functions and ranges when they are selected, so you will need a list showing what and where they are located on the rotary switch.<br>In my tutorial, I describe the meter in detail, and demonstrate some of its functions.<br>I have also included a table which summarizes the functions and ranges.</p>
<p>Here is a link where the unit can be purchased. For legal reasons, they say it is not recommended for visually impaired users.<br><a href="https://www.mpja.com/Talking-Digital-Multimeter/productinfo/35042%20ME/">Talking Digital Multimeter Page</a></p>
<p>Since the meter does not come with a case, I found a suitable one made by Klein Tools. Here is a link where it can be purchased.<br><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004O9IWXK?ref_=pe_386300_442618370_TE_sc_as_ri_0">Klein Tools multimeter case</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The table can be found at Joe&#39;s website below.</p>
