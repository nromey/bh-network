# Net Happenings: The Nert Returns
## By: Noel Romey (K5NER)
Well, it's that time again, time for yet another K5NERt, a Blind Hams Digital Nert for short. That isn't something that should or is earth shatterying, but a nert is simply a net that's being controlled by your truly, NOel Romey.

The topic for today's net is in honor of the United States Thanksgiving holiday y which happens at the end of the month for us.  Canada, you've already had your fun, food, and family. But this topic spans continents and cultures.  What are you grateful for this year? Could be a ham radio related gratitude, or a generally awesome gratitude you want to tell us about.  As always, the net is today at 10:00 AM Eastern, so I hope to see you there!

Not much happening on the web side of things since I last posted. I *am* working on ... stuff ... but the stuff that I'm working on and with is all on the back end of the web page.  All these changes let me add new nets to the system, preview and apoprove edited new nets, and take suggestions for nets by you, my trusty readers.

You read it right, you will be able to suggest that a net be added to our ever-growing net directly from this web page.  I still need to do some tests to make sure that the suggestions make it to me, and once I verify that the bits are connected to bobs and the bobs are connected back to other bits, I'll share the link.

I'd like to create a net directory, especially for digital nets like those we see on Allstar, to rival no other net directory.  YOu will be part of that.  So once I let you and the mailing lists know that things are ready, please feel free to suggest away.

I'm also taking suggestions for allstar, echolink, and other node types and/or talk groups where blind and visually impaired hfolks hang out.  Nodes have become somewhat fragmented over the past month or so, so I'm hoping to compile a good list of nodes where you can throw out a question about a radio, about assistive technology, or about any other blindness related topic to folks of like mind.

Stay tuned for more news about how to suggest a net in the coming week.  If you have any questions or would like to contact me or anyone else on staff, [View Our Contact List](/contacts/) for more details and contact methods.

As always, 73 de K5NER. Stay radio-active, situationally aware, and most importantly, keep smiling!
