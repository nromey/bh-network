Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>In this podcast, Robert, NC5R, explores how blind hams have struggled to figure out ways to operate inaccessible radios. He talks about how radio manufacturers should and could provide their radios with accessible firmware. Robert describes how the struggle frequently reduces the pleasure that blind hams get out of &nbsp;the hobby. He demonstrates how the Accessible GD77 firmware has proven that when radios are 100 percent accessible blind hams can find the same level of enjoyment as do sighted hams.&nbsp;</p>
