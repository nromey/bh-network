Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>Here, I look at the Quansheng UV-K5 handheld transceiver, a low-cost handheld radio that&#39;s been getting a fair bit of attention lately. Specifically, I’m looking at how it might be a useful rig for blind operators. Be kind, it&#39;s my first Youtube video review with actual video, and excuse the audio levels as I just recorded on my iPhone on a tripod. Thanks to my wife Angie for manning (personing?) the camera, to Quansheng Electronics for providing radios to play with, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_jX41l6nYfnrQuk0qsZFw" rel="nofollow">@HamRadioDX</a> &#39;and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9a8Z6Sp6eb2s3O79pX5Zvg" rel="nofollow">@TechMindsOfficial</a> reviews for lots of great initial information and tips.
