#Suggest a net is now live!"

Got a net you want to promote on the blind hams Digital network web page? Do you want your net displayed among other nets with the ability to show your net in "my time"?

Now, there's an easy way to promote yours or any net simply by visiting the [Suggest A Net Page](/nets/suggest).Enter a net name and information about the net such as start time, duration, and mode or frequency of the net, and we'll take it from there.  Make sure to include your name and email so we can contact you should we have questions the update process.

We hope that this will be helpful, and will help our directory spotlight your net soon!
