Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>Talkpod sent us the A36 plus GMRS to review. It is a good replacement for a UV5R. It has several features that may make it a good first radio. Like USB charging on the battery along with airband and a few others.

You can look at the Talkpod A36 plus at Amazon link below.
