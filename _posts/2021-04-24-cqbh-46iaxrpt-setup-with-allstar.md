Description (from CQ Blind Hams):

<p>Today N1CA Julian and W0CAS Joel setup IAXRPT for the first time using a ClearNode on AllStar.</p>
<p>Getting Started with, and setting up IAXRPT<br>
<br>
Visit: <a href="http://blindhams.com/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">blindhams.com</a>, find and activate the "Ham radio links" link, find<br>
and activate the "I A X R P T Download and setup instructions" link, and<br>
if you are a JAWS user you'll also want to find and activate the "I A X<br>
R P T JAWS Scripts" link to download these helpful scripts for JAWS,<br>
generously written and contributed by KN6GAA.<br>
Note: JAWS users will want to install the scripts before opening IAXRPT.<br>
<br>
Part 1: If using Clear node and it's app<br>
1. Open Clear Node App, then find and activate the button&nbsp; that mentions<br>
your AllStar node number.<br>
Note: if you don't already have it memorized, find and make a note of<br>
your node's IP address listed on this screen, which you will need to<br>
enter into IAXRPT.<br>
2. Find and activate the "AllStar Setup" button<br>
3. Find and open the edit field called "User IAXRPT Password"<br>
4. If you haven't already entered one, or one wasn't already entered for<br>
you, create and enter one in the blank edit field and make a note of it<br>
as you'll need to enter it into IAXRPT.<br>
I recommend using the same password that you use as your node password,<br>
it can be found in the edit field directly above or before the edit<br>
field you just opened.<br>
If you already have a password that appears in the IAXRPT password<br>
field, then there's no need to enter anything, just make a note of it<br>
and proceed to Part 2.<br>
<br>
Part 2: Setting up IAXRPT to connect to your node.<br>
1. Open IAXRPT.<br>
2. Press Alt+O to open the Options Menu, arrow down to Accounts, then<br>
press enter to activate.<br>
This will open the Manage Accounts dialog box.<br>
3. Find and activate the "Add..." button.<br>
4. In the "Account name" field, enter your AllStar node number.<br>
5. In the "Description" field, you can enter anything you like. I<br>
entered "Clear Node".<br>
6. In the "host" field, enter your node's IP address.<br>
7. In the "user name" field, enter "iaxrpt" in lower case and without<br>
the quotes.<br>
8. In the "Password" field, enter the IAXRPT password you either found<br>
or created in the Clear Node App.<br>
In the "confirm" field, re-enter the password you entered in the field<br>
above.<br>
9. In the "type" combo box, choose Duplex, this will enable full duplex<br>
operation.<br>
You can pretty much skip through the remaining options. Note that in my<br>
setup I have the "Show Connection", and "Log to Display", checkboxes<br>
checked.<br>
10. Find and activate the "Save button. If this doesn't take you back to<br>
the main screen, find and activate the "Done" button. This should take<br>
you back to the main screen.<br>
11. Once on the main screen, press Alt+O again but this time arrow down<br>
to and activate "Preferences", this will open the "Preferences dialog box.<br>
12. Find and activate the "Caller ID" tab.<br>
13. In the "Name" field, enter your callsign in all caps.<br>
14. In the "number" field, by default it should be set to "0", if not,<br>
enter 0.<br>
15. Find and activate the "Save button. If this doesn't take you back to<br>
the main screen, find and activate the "Done" button. This should take<br>
you back to the main screen.<br>
16. You are now ready to connect to your node by finding and activating<br>
the "Connect" button.<br>
Note: JAWS&nbsp; users who installed the scripts can press Alt+C to connect<br>
and Alt+D to disconnect, other helpful key commands can be found by<br>
pressing Insert+H. There are other more advanced settings that you'll<br>
eventually explore to adjust things like audio and mic levels.<br>
Good luck, 73.<br>
<br>
Julian N1CA</p>
