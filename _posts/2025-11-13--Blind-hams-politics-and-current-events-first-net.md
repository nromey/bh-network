# Welcome to the inaugural Politics and Current Events (PACE) Net, net 1
Tonight starts a biweekly tradition on the Blind Hams Network at 7 PM on the Second and fourth Thursdays of the month.  The Blind Hams Politics and Current Events Net starts today at 7 PM eastern.  See www.blindhams.network for more information and for the time that the net arrives in your time zone.  If you'd not like to participate, disconnect your nodes and repeaters until 8:30 Eastern or thereabouts, and the network will return to normal at that time.

* The U.S. government opened today after a record long shutdown.  Our PACE question is, is there a point to having shutdowns? Has the shutdown accomplished anything? Have you been effected by the shut down?
* Our amateur radio topic to think about is ... Do you like DX, contesting, or just general rag chew? Do you like to hunt the elusive country, or are you into hanging with a group on 80 or 160 meters?  Tell us what you like.

Pace is a round table net. Everyone **will** have a chance to speak on the topics of the day or a topic of their choice.  For every person who speaks, and to keep the conversation moving, three re-checks or responses will be allowed, then we'll move to the next person.  Try to keep your comments to between one to two minutes with transmission breaks to give the system a chance to breathe.

Looking forward to this experience, it's going to be fun.
