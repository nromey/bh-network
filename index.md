# Welcome to the Blind Hams Digital Network!

The **Blind Hams Digital Network** is a community built by and for blind and visually impaired amateur radio operators. While many of our conversations highlight accessibility and tools that work well for us, **all licensed radio amateurs are welcome** to join in.

This site is a work in progress, and we’ll keep improving it. Thanks for your patience while things evolve.

## What’s coming
- Up-to-the-minute solar data and a calculated MUF based on your location, presented in a clean, accessible format.
- A quick “Up next” list of upcoming nets on the system.
- Organized, filterable info on accessible radios and accessibility tips for various rigs.
- A files area where you can download (and submit) useful ham-radio software and data.
- Community guidelines: clear, short, and friendly.
- A page listing all nodes and ways to access the system.

## What you can do today
- Browse current nets on our network (and a few partner nets). If we’re missing one, let us know! The new system makes it super easy to add them so don't be shy, the sky's the limit!
- Check the NCO rotation for our flagship Saturday morning net:
