# How to Connect to the Blind Hams Network

This page covers connection options (AllStar, EchoLink, DMR, D‑STAR, YSF, Alexa, and the live stream). For on‑air behavior and expectations, see our <a href="/nets/blind-hams/etiquette/">Tips and Etiquette</a> page.

## AllStar {#allstar}

Use the regional nodes closest to you for best latency and less packet loss.

{% include allstar_nodes_table.md %}

Notes on using AllStar on the network
- If you are using app-based “web transceiver” tools like RepeaterPhone or DVSwitch, connect to node 506317. The other AllStar nodes may refuse web-transceiver connections unless you are using your own [AllStarLink](https://www.allstarlink.org) node. Once connected appropriately, you are welcome to link to nodes 506310–506315 and 506318.
- Use node 506318 for longer QSOs and free‑form conversation. Standard amateur radio rules still apply everywhere, but for topics that may run long or get spirited, please move to 506318 or other nodes that are set up for that purpose.
- Want to listen only (no transmit)? Use the live audio stream below.
## DMR {#dmr}

You can connect to the Blind Hams Network via:
- [Amcomm](https://www.amcomm.network) TG31679
- [TGIF](https://tgif.network) TG31679
- [FreeSTAR](https://freestar.network) TG87

Note: We do not link to BrandMeister due to their current cross‑network linking policies.
 
 ## D-STAR {#d-star}

Connect to XLX679A to link directly to the network.

## YSF {#ysf}

Connect to YSF 76138. WIRES‑X is no longer used on the network.

## EchoLink {#echolink}

Connect to the \*BLIND\* conference if you would like to use [EchoLink](https://www.echolink.org).

## Alexa and Audio Streams {#alexa-audio}

There are several ways to listen to the Blind Hams Network on your
computer, smartphone, or Alexa‑enabled smart speaker.

To listen inside a web browser or dedicated media player, use:
<http://stream.borris.me:8888/blind-hams>
This also works in specialized players such as the Victor Reader Stream.

Note: Some browsers block mixed content (HTTP audio on HTTPS pages). If the player does not start, open the stream URL directly or use the Alexa method below.

{% include able_audio.html 
   title="Live Blind Hams Network audio stream" 
   src="http://stream.borris.me:8888/blind-hams" 
   fallback_url="http://stream.borris.me:8888/blind-hams" %}

To listen on Alexa, ask your device to “enable the Blind Hams Network.” Once enabled, try:
“play the Blind Hams Network” or “listen to the Blind Hams Network.”

You can also find the Blind Hams Network on Broadcastify (lower quality and more delay). Broadcastify Premium subscribers can get a year of rolling archives:
