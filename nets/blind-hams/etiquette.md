# Tips and Etiquette

These guidelines help keep the Blind Hams Digital Network welcoming, clear, and fun to use. Please share this link if you’re helping someone get started.

## Quick Tips {#tips}
- Identify with your callsign, following the rules of your country’s amateur radio service.
- Leave a short pause between transmissions so linked systems can catch up and others can break in.
- Be welcoming. All licensed operators are invited to use the network.

## Identify and Pauses {#identify-pauses}
- Say your callsign when you first join a conversation and at appropriate intervals per your jurisdiction.
- Short pauses between overs help avoid doubling and let bridges sync.

## Longer QSOs and Topics {#long-qsos}
- Use AllStar node 506318 for longer QSOs and free‑form conversation.
- For especially long or niche topics, consider moving to another appropriate node (e.g., NE5L node 507295).

## Conduct {#conduct}
- A wide range of topics is allowed (including politics and religion). Keep it civil and focus on ideas, not people.
- No personal attacks, harassment, or deliberate jamming.

## Listeners and Live Stream {#listeners}
- Listeners are welcome. To listen without transmitting, use the live stream linked on the Connect page.

## Getting Connected {#connect}
- For connection instructions (AllStar, EchoLink, DMR, D‑STAR, YSF, Alexa), see the
  <a href="/nets/blind-hams/connect/">How to Connect</a> page.
