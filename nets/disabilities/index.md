This page highlights nets of interest to blind, low-vision, and disability communities.
These aren’t directly managed by the Blind Hams Network, but we list them here so folks
can easily find and join. If you have a net to suggest, contact
<span id="contact-email">
  <script>
    document.write('<a href="mailto:' + 'k5ner' + '@' + 'email.cc">' +
                   'k5ner' + '@' + 'email.cc</a>');
  </script>
  <noscript>k5ner [at] email [dot] cc</noscript>
</span>
and we’ll get it added.
