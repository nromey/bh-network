Solar Flux Index is 154 (90-day mean 153, reported during the afternoon reading). The sunspot number is 122, covering roughly 680 millionths of the solar hemisphere, with no new regions observed as of 13 October 2025 UTC. The planetary K index at 00:00 UTC is 0.00, indicating quiet conditions, and the planetary A index is 0. The mid-latitude Boulder K index at 00:00 UTC is 0.00, also indicating quiet conditions, and the Boulder A index is 0. Solar wind speed is 571 kilometers per second with density 2.049 particles per cubic centimeter and temperature 88,503 Kelvin according to ACE. GOES-18 reports X-ray flux on the 0.1–0.8 nanometre band at 4.51 times 10 to the minus 6 watts per square metre, class C2.6. On the 0.05–0.4 nanometre band the flux is 6.0 times 10 to the minus 7 watts per square metre. Here is the 24-hour flare outlook: C-class 99 percent, M-class 55 percent, X-class 15 percent. The 10 mega-electron-volt proton event probability is 10 percent. Polar cap absorption level is green.
