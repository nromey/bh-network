# Flare and Proton Forecasts

NOAA’s Space Weather Prediction Center issues daily probabilities for solar flares and energetic proton events. These numbers estimate the chance of at least one event in the next 24, 48, or 72 hours.

## Flare Classes

- **C-class (moderate):** Can cause brief fadeouts on daylight HF paths above 10&nbsp;MHz, especially when several eruptions happen in a row.
- **M-class (strong):** Expect daytime blackouts on the sunlit side, plus elevated absorption on 40–15 meters.
- **X-class (extreme):** Major events capable of wide-area shortwave blackouts and triggering proton storms.

## Proton Events (10 MeV)

Energetic protons follow strong flares or CME shocks. When the 10&nbsp;MeV proton chance is high, polar paths may suffer heavy absorption for hours or days. Aviation HF routes and amateur polar hops are the first to feel it.

## Using the Forecasts

- **High C-class but low M/X:** Expect occasional fadeouts but generally usable bands.
- **M-class ≥30% or X-class ≥10%:** Plan for sudden daytime losses on higher bands, and keep lower frequencies on standby.
- **Elevated proton chances:** Favor equatorial or mid-latitude paths; NVIS on 80/40 meters can remain reliable when polar circuits are noisy.

Our solar dashboard shows the day-one values on the card for quick reference, and the `/solar/` page will expand with tools to chart trends and correlate them with band reports.
