# Solar Wind Basics

The solar wind is a continuous stream of charged particles flowing from the Sun. Space-weather dashboards track three parts of that stream because they drive geomagnetic storms:

- **Speed (km/s):** Typical background wind is 300–400 km/s. When speed jumps above ~500 km/s, Earth’s magnetic field gets compressed and Kp often climbs.
- **Density (particles per cm³):** Higher density means more material slamming into the magnetosphere. A surge in both speed and density is a red flag for HF absorption and auroral noise.
- **Temperature (Kelvin):** Hotter plasma hints that the wind is coming from coronal holes or CME ejecta, both of which can energize the geomagnetic field.

Combine the solar wind data with the K/A indices. Rising wind speed followed by elevated Kp tells you a storm is in progress. If speed is high but Kp stays low, the magnetosphere is handling the flow and HF conditions should remain steady. Monitoring the trend over a few hours gives you early warning before the bands get noisy.
