# GOES X-ray Flux

NOAA’s GOES satellites measure the Sun’s soft X-ray output in two bands: 0.1–0.8 nm and 0.05–0.4 nm. The higher-energy bursts correlate with solar flares, which can trigger sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) and shortwave fadeouts.

Flares are labeled by class:

- **A & B:** Very small events. Minimal impact on HF.
- **C-class:** Moderate flares. Can cause brief absorption on daylight paths above 10 MHz.
- **M-class:** Strong flares. Daytime HF blackouts on sunlit paths are common, especially on 15 meters and above.
- **X-class:** Major flares. Expect wide-area shortwave fadeouts and the potential for energetic particle events.

When the X-ray flux climbs to C-level or higher, keep an ear on your daylight skip: sudden drops in signal strength or an S-meter that slams to zero are classic SID signatures. After a strong flare, the resulting particle storm can also raise the noise floor on polar paths. Monitoring the flux helps you separate a true band closure from a local equipment issue.
