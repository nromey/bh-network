# Solar Flux Index (SFI)

The Solar Flux Index is a daily measurement of the Sun’s radio output at 2800&nbsp;MHz. Think of it as a quick “fuel gauge” for the ionosphere: higher SFI usually means the F-layer is denser and can support higher frequency paths.

- **Typical values:** 60–80 in solar minimum, 150+ near solar maximum. HF openings on 15, 12, and 10&nbsp;meters usually need SFI above ~100.
- **90-day mean:** A rolling average that smooths out short-term swings. If today’s SFI is above the mean, the upper bands may outperform the long-term expectation.
- **Why it matters:** A higher F-layer critical frequency raises the MUF (maximum usable frequency), allowing longer skip and higher bands to stay open later in the day.

Remember that SFI is only part of the story. Geomagnetic activity (Kp/Ap) and the D- and E-layers can still limit propagation even when SFI is high. Use SFI as a first glance: great SFI with a quiet geomagnetic field is when HF really shines.
