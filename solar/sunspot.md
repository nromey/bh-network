# Sunspot Number

The daily **sunspot number** is a quick head-count of visible active regions on the Sun. NOAA’s SESC value blends the number of individual spots and the groups they belong to, so it rises whenever the solar disk is crowded with magnetically active regions.

- **Higher numbers usually track higher SFI.** More spots often means more ultraviolet radiation and stronger F-layer ionization, especially for the upper HF bands.
- **Area (millionths of a solar hemisphere):** Large active regions are more likely to produce flares or coronal mass ejections. We surface the total area so you can gauge how substantial the current regions are.
- **New regions:** Freshly numbered regions can signal emerging activity. A big uptick suggests the Sun is waking up even if today’s SFI has not yet climbed.

Use the sunspot number alongside SFI. A high SFI with rapidly growing sunspot area points to solid high-band propagation; a high SFI but shrinking sunspot coverage can foreshadow a dip. Coupling the number with flare probabilities helps you anticipate whether conditions are likely to stay stable or get stormy.
