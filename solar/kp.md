# K and A Indices

The **K-index** is a scale (0–9) that reports how disturbed Earth’s magnetic field has been during the past three hours. It reacts quickly to solar wind shocks and geomagnetic storms. A higher K means the ionosphere is being stirred up, which can cause HF fading and auroral absorption on polar paths.

- **Quiet:** K 0–1 — stable conditions, minimal auroral absorption.
- **Unsettled/Active:** K 2–3 — minor fading, higher latitudes feel it first.
- **Storm levels:** K ≥4 — expect noticeable degradation; polar and trans-auroral paths can close.

The **A-index** converts the past 24 hours of K readings into a single linear number (typically 0–60). It smooths the story: low A with occasional small K spikes is less disruptive than a long run of elevated K. When you see A above ~20, even mid-latitude HF can sound rough.

On the Blind Hams dashboard you’ll see two flavours of K: the global **planetary Kp** and the **Boulder mid-latitude K**. Planetary Kp reflects the worldwide average, while the Boulder trace shows how the storm feels across the central United States. When both rise together a geomagnetic storm is underway everywhere; when Kp spikes but Boulder stays low, polar and transauroral paths suffer first while mid-latitude circuits may hold up a little longer.

We also translate each K reading into a rough **noise estimate**: every step of K beyond 2 adds about one S-unit to the HF noise floor. For example, Kp ≈4 is reported as “+3 S-units,” warning that even strong signals could sound buried in hiss. Quiet values (K <2) stay at the baseline “S0.”

**How to use them:** Pair Kp/Ap with SFI. High SFI _and_ low K/A means strong, stable propagation. When K jumps, watch for absorption on 80–40&nbsp;meters, shifting MUF on 20 meters and above, and noisy polar routes. For emergency communications, Kp gives you the heads-up to lean on near-vertical incidence or lower bands.
