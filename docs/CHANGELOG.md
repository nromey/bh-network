# Changelog

## 2025-09-29
- Added narration when switching between table/headings views on nets pages, then refined it with toggle buttons to keep NVDA/JAWS output predictable.
- Hid the decorative down-arrow next to the “See NCO schedule” link from assistive tech so screen readers no longer announce “down arrow.”
- Added `docs/TODO.md` to track future accessibility enhancements such as keyboard shortcuts for the view toggle.
- Added `scripts/oai_lkoginmethod` helper to switch between ChatGPT subscription tokens and encrypted OpenAI API key usage for the Codex CLI.
