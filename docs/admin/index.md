# Blind Hams Admin Guide

Short, human-friendly instructions for maintaining the site and schedules.

- How to Add a Net: add-a-net.md
- Manage NCOs (Blind Hams net): manage-nco.md

Tips
- Use diagnostics by appending `?diag=1` to pages. You’ll see status lines like “Live data loaded …” under widgets/tables.
- Time toggle: the site can show “Net time” (as written in the event’s time zone) or “My time” (your local). This affects labels on the home and category pages; the NCO table always shows a fixed net time.
- If live data briefly fails, pages fall back to the server-rendered scaffolds so the site stays usable.
